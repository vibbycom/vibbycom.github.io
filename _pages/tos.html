        <li><span class="underline">Reposting of Content Subject to a Counter Notification.</span> If you submit a Counter Notification to Vibby in response to a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then Vibby will promptly provide the person who provided the Notification of Claimed Infringement with a copy of your Counter Notification and inform that person that Vibby will replace the removed Vibber Content or Feedback or cease disabling access to it in 10 business days, and Vibby will replace the removed Vibber Content or Feedback and cease disabling access to it not less than 10, nor more than 14, business days following receipt of the Counter Notification, unless Vibby&rsquo;s Designated Agent receives notice from the party that submitted the Notification of Claimed Infringement that such person has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the user from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on Vibby&rsquo;s system or network.</li>

        <li class="list-top-heading">Dispute Resolution.</li>
        <ol class="lower-latin">
          <li><span class="underline">Generally.</span> In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Vibby in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Vibby agree that any dispute arising out of or in any way related to this Agreement or your use of the Service will be resolved by binding arbitration.Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court.Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or in any way related to this Agreement or your use of the Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of this Agreement.YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND VIBBY ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AND THAT THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE SUBJECT TO AND GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT.</li>
          <li><span class="underline">Exceptions.</span> Notwithstanding Section 10.a above, nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in aid of arbitration from a court of competent jurisdiction; or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</li>
          <li><span class="underline">Arbitrator.</span> Any arbitration between you and Vibby will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, &ldquo;<strong>AAA Rules</strong>&rdquo;) of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;<strong>AAA</strong>&rdquo;), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA.The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at <a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Vibby.The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.</li>
          <li><span class="underline">Notice; Process.</span> A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by U.S. Mail or email (&ldquo;<strong>Notice</strong>&rdquo;). Vibby&rsquo;s address for Notice is: Vibby, Inc., 350 5th Ave, Suite 7610, New York,&nbsp;NY&nbsp;10118 or contact@vibby.com.The Notice must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (&ldquo;<strong>Demand</strong>&rdquo;).The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Vibby may commence an arbitration proceeding.During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Vibby must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor with a monetary award that exceeds the last written settlement amount offered by Vibby prior to selection of an arbitrator, then Vibby will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by Vibby in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator&rsquo;s award; or (iii) $15,000.</li>
          <li><span class="underline">Fees.</span> If you commence arbitration in accordance with this Agreement, Vibby will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $15,000 or as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules.Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in New York, New York, but if the claim is for $15,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Vibby for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.Each party agrees that such written decision, and information exchanged during arbitration, will be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to enforce or permit limited judicial review of the award.The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator&rsquo;s ruling on the merits.</li>
          <li><span class="underline">No Class Actions.</span> YOU AND VIBBY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.Further, unless both you and Vibby agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person&rsquo;s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</li>
          <li><span class="underline">Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.</span> Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, if Vibby makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Vibby&rsquo;s address for Notice, then you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Vibby&rsquo;s address for Notice, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will continue to govern any disputes between you and Vibby.</li>
          <li><span class="underline">Enforceability.</span> If Section 10.f above is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 10 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 10 will be null and void.</li>
